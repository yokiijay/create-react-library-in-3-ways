## ↖ You can switch the branch to download the 3 ways of project.

## 1. Rollup ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐
Easy configuration and powerful

## 2. Webpack ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Heavy configuration, but powerful and minimized well, a little bit difficult to configure the local dev mode.

## 3. Babel ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Super simple, and very quickly to configure, highly recommend.
